Grade Bot Goes Public!
## Access StudentVUE within Discord
View your grades, schedule, and more in Discord! This bot is entirely open source to maintain transparency, and demonstrate how Discord's API can be used to access other external API'S.
## Features
- View your overall grades for each class
- View your schedule
- Login (Saved between sessions & Credentials can't be viewed by anyone but you)
- Find school districts near your zipcode
- (More Features Coming Soon)
## Setup/Install
Before you can use the bot, you'll need to create a new discord app through the discord developer portal. A good guide to getting started can be found [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started). Once that is set up and the bot is added to your server, save your bot's client id and token somewhere private and secure. You'll need it later.  
Now you need to install the bot. Here are the steps to clone the bot, and get it up and running:  
- Install Node.js and NPM
- Clone the repository and install the dependencies
```bash
git clone 
cd gradebot
npm install
```
